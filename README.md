Using https://pypi.org/project/PyQt6/

- build a GUI that accesses urls and returns status codes.

I love making interactive things but python was never my go to for User interfaces. Python has a built in GUI libray, Tkinter, however I found it to be a little outfdated looking and somewhat difficuly to use. With the urge to create I found PyQt6.
