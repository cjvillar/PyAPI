# PyAPI

I love making interactive things but Python was never my go-to for good-looking user interfaces. Python has a built-in GUI library, Tkinter. However, I found it to be a little outdated looking and somewhat difficult to use. With the urge to create I found PyQt6. This repo contains my learning project PyAPI. It's not meant to be a production app but more as an evolving project to learn PyQt6 in my spare time.

Using https://pypi.org/project/PyQt6/
- build a GUI that accesses URLs and returns status codes/data.
